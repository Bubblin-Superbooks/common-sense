<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How impious is the title of sacred majesty applied to a worm, who in the midst of his splendor is crumbling into dust!</p><p>As the exalting one man so greatly above the rest cannot be justified on the equal rights of nature, so neither can it be defended on the authority of scripture; for the will of the Almighty, as declared by Gideon and the prophet Samuel, expressly disapproves of government by kings. All anti-monarchical parts of scripture have been very smoothly glossed over in monarchical governments, but they undoubtedly merit the attention of countries which have their governments yet to form. &ldquo;Render unto C&aelig;sar the things which are C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s&rdquo; is the scripture doctrine of courts, yet it is no support of monarchical government, for the Jews at that time were without a king, and in a state of vassalage to the Romans.</p></div> </div>
