Nature hath deserted the connexion, and Art cannot supply her place. For, as Milton wisely expresses, &ldquo;never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep.&rdquo;</p><p>Every quiet method for peace hath been ineffectual. Our prayers have been rejected with disdain; and only tended to convince us, that nothing flatters vanity, or confirms obstinacy in Kings more than repeated petitioning&mdash;</p></div> </div>
