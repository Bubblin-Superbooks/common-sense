<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>General Charles Lee</p><p>This production of the Bradford edition of Common Sense retains the original characteristics of the document&mdash;the author's use of capitalization (large and small), spelling, and italics.</p><p>The page numbers of this version of the book were my invention, for ease in reading the HTML document. The page numbers can more accurately be called paragraph numbers. They match the paragraph numbers in the edited text of &lsquo;Common Sense&rsquo; from the National Humanities Center.</p><p>In one case, the text refers to page forty (see our ). We provided a link to the appropriate part of our document but retained the page number specified by Paine. Our page numbers are not carried over to the Kindle, E-PUB, and text documents produced by Project Gutenberg.</p></div> </div>
