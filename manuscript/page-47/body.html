<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In absolute monarchies the whole weight of business, civil and military, lies on the king; the children of Israel in their request for a king, urged this plea &ldquo;that he may judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles.&rdquo; But in countries where he is neither a judge nor a general, as in England, a man would be puzzled to know what is his business.</p><p>The nearer any government approaches to a republic the less business there is for a king. It is somewhat difficult to find a proper name for the government of England. Sir William Meredith calls it a republic; but in its present state it is unworthy of the name, because the corrupt influence of the crown, by having all the places in its disposal, hath so effectually swallowed up the power, and eaten out the virtue of the house of commons (the republican part in the constitution) that the government of England is nearly as monarchical as that of France or Spain.</p></div> </div>
