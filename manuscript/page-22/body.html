<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To say that the constitution of England is a union of three powers reciprocally checking each other, is farcical, either the words have no meaning, or they are flat contradictions.</p><p>To say that the commons is a check upon the king, presupposes two things:</p><p>First.&mdash;That the king is not to be trusted without being looked after, or in other words, that a thirst for absolute power is the natural disease of monarchy.</p><p>Secondly.&mdash;That the commons, by being appointed for that purpose, are either wiser or more worthy of confidence than the crown.</p><p>But as the same constitution which gives the commons a power to check the king by withholding the supplies, gives afterwards the king a power to check the commons, by empowering him to reject their other bills; it again supposes that the king is wiser than those whom it has already supposed to be wiser than him. A mere absurdity!</p></div> </div>
