But that it is imperfect, subject to convulsions, and incapable of producing what it seems to promise, is easily demonstrated.</p><p>Absolute governments (tho&rsquo; the disgrace of human nature) have this advantage with them, that they are simple; if the people suffer, they know the head from which their suffering springs, know likewise the remedy, and are not bewildered by a variety of causes and cures. But the constitution of England is so exceedingly complex, that the nation may suffer for years together without being able to discover in which part the fault lies, some will say in one and some in another, and every political physician will advise a different medicine.</p></div> </div>
