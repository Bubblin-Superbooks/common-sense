<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To unite the sinews of commerce and defense is sound policy; for when our strength and our riches play into each other&rsquo;s hand, we need fear no external enemy.</p><p>In almost every article of defense we abound. Hemp flourishes even to rankness, so that we need not want cordage. Our iron is superior to that of other countries. Our small arms equal to any in the world. Cannon we can cast at pleasure. Saltpetre and gunpowder we are every day producing. Our knowledge is hourly improving. Resolution is our inherent character, and courage hath never yet forsaken us. Wherefore, what is it that we want? Why is it that we hesitate? From Britain we can expect nothing but ruin. If she is once admitted to the government of America again, this Continent will not be worth living in.</p></div> </div>
